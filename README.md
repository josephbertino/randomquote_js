#### Author: Joe Bertino

### A webpage that displays quotes from an array, in a random fashion.

### Every time you generate a new random quote by clicking the "Show Another Quote" button, the background color of the web page will change.

### The page will also refresh itself with a new random quote every 10 seconds (independent of user interaction).
